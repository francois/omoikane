# Omoikane

[Omoikane is the God of Knowledge in the Shinto religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omoikane_(Shinto)). The Omoikane
application is a simple Sinatra application designed to run queries against a specific server. All query results are
browseable online, and results can be easily exported as CSV. There exists the concept of a project, where a project
is represented as a series of queries, which can be run multiple times as each query can be parameterized.


# Installation

Clone the directory somewhere, edit the Gemfile and add your preferred database library or libraries:

* `gem "pg"`
* `gem "sqlite"`
* `gem "mysql"`

Once you've added one or more libraries, you must bundle, to calculate the correct dependencies:

    $ bundle install


## Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the project's root directory, with the correct values for your environment:

* `SESSION_SECRET`: Run `dd if=/dev/random of=- bs=1024 count=1 | sha256sum` and use the results as your secret;
* `JOBSDIR`: Create a directory in which Omoikane can store all it's application files;
* `RUBYOPT`: Set to `-Ilib`.
* `OMOIKANE_DATABASE_URL`: The [Sequel](http://sequel.jeremyevans.net/) URL of a database where Omoikane will store it's state.
* `OMOIKANE_TARGET_URL`: The [Sequel](http://sequel.jeremyevans.net/) URL of the database you want to query over Omoikane.

### Notifications

__NOTE__: This part is still in flux. In the original version, it worked, but the latest version does not. We're working on this.

If you wish to provide push notifications for your users, open a free account at [Pusher](https://pusher.com/). With
your credentials, create two new environment variables, with the values Pusher will provide you:

* `PUSHER_APP_KEY`
* `NOTIFICATION_PUSHER_URL`

Once those variables are available in the environment, direct your users to the home page of Omoikane, where they
can enable push notifications for themselves. Push notifications are directed to only the person which made the query.
When John submits a job, Jane won't be notified that the job has completed.


# Running

Start Omoikane's services using [Foreman](https://github.com/ddollar/foreman):

    $ bundle exec foreman start

This will launch two services: the web process as well as a worker process, which runs the actual queries.

You may wish to run Omoikane from [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/).
